#footnote; for making it mostly conjunct motion, I could weight the random choice so it is more likely to choose conjunct motion
#or I could cap the jumps to 1 or 2 times per cf, and once the cf is out of jumps it cant jump again
#TODO now cantus firmus is only missing direction, mostly conjunct motion, minor keys, arpeggios, 
#make it less likely to leap right after leap, then gradually increase likelihood
#filter to probabilities (replace stepbackreq)
#deal with all 0 prob
#dynamically update pitch range, pull up limits
#some percentage close to the end (maybe early stopping once past lower limit)
#probability array
------------------Notes from Oct 22--------------------------------------

#only leap to leading tone down.
#bigger leap means more conjunct motion to cancel it out

#arpeggio
#aesthetic creativity
#formalizing formal rules
#encoding rules
#nature of creativity
#inspiration
#music theory is making musical creativity into rules
#people can create without being genusis
#is there a difference (what can a human do but not a computer)

#how far should climax be from beginning and end, and how much does that matter
